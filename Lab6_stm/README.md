This project focused on using the audio recording and playback capabilities of the board. When the push button was pressed, the green LED turns on to indicate that the board is recording audio via the DFSDM conversion.

From there, the audio was converted using the DAC and played back over headphones plugged into the board. 

STMCube was used to generate the base project.
